abstract = {The thesis focuses on the attitude determination system of a satellite. Attitude determination is the process of computing the spacecraft orientation relative to inertial reference frame such as the Earth center inertial frame. The attitude determination process is critical in satellite operation as it is required to control the satellite attitude in a specified direction.},
