The spearman correlation approach provides reliable recognition even when the captured images are swayed and biased from the onboard star pattern database. The hamming distance approach provides a shortlisted list of star IDs. Thus, the proposed combination of hamming distance and spearman correlation provides a reliable and fast recognition. The achievable performance is evaluated by testing on simulated and real images.},

abstract = {Programmable Logic has become more and more common as a core technology used to build electronic systems. By integrating soft-core or hardcore processors, these devices have become complete systems on a chip, steadily displacing general purpose processors and ASICs. In particular, high performance systems are now almost always implemented with FPGAs. This course will give you the foundation for FPGA design in Embedded Systems along with practical design skills. You will learn what an FPGA is and how this technology was developed, how to select the best FPGA architecture for a given application, how to use state of the art software tools for FPGA development, and solve critical digital design problems using FPGAs. You use FPGA development tools to complete several example designs, including a custom processor. If you are thinking of a career in Electronics Design or an engineer looking at a career change, this is a great course to enhance your career opportunities. Hardware Requirements: You must have access to computer resources to run the development tools, a PC running either Windows 7, 8, or 10 or a recent Linux OS which must be RHEL 6.5 or CentOS Linux 6.5 or later. Either Linux OS could be run as a virtual machine under Windows 8 or 10. The tools do not run on Apple Mac computers. Whatever the OS, the computer must have at least 8 GB of RAM. Most new laptops will have this, or it may be possible to upgrade the memory.},

abstract = {Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are integrated cir-cuits that enable designers to program customized digital logic in the field. FPGAs have been around since the 1980s and were originally conceived to give all design teams the ability to create custom logic. In the early days, using an FPGA in your design meant you had to do a lot of programming just to get your FPGA to perform simple functions, so most design-ers avoided them. If you haven't looked into FPGAs since your university studies way back when, you'll want to take another look at them.The FPGA has evolved from a useful but humble interface device into a system-level integrated circuit (IC) with its own microprocessors, memory blocks, and interfaces. It's the next big thing.Now would be a great time to get an inexpensive development kit, download free tools, and begin to explore this world for yourself. And this book will help you understand the practical uses of FPGAs.},

The algorithm took advantage of an efficient on-board database and an original “4-star matching” pattern recognition strategy to achieve fast and reliable star identification. The on-board database was composed of a brightness independent guide star catalog (mission catalog) and a K-vector star pair catalog. The star pattern recognition method involved direct location of star pair candidates and a simple array matching procedure. Tests of the algorithm with a CMOS active pixel sensor (APS) star tracker result in a 99.9{\%} success rate for star identification for lost-in-space 3-axis attitude acquisition when the angular measurement accuracy of the star tracker is at least 0.01°.

The design of a star tracker that will operate in this environment must overcome many challenging problems. Ionizing radiation will cause ordinary optical glass to darken. Silicon based detectors typically experience threshold shifts, increased dark current, reduced quantum efficiency and reduced charge transfer efficiency (in the case of CCDs).

The algorithm is based on a geometric voting scheme in which a pair of stars in the catalogue votes for a pair of stars in the image if the angular distance between the stars of both pairs is similar. As angular distance is a symmetric relationship, each of the two catalogue stars votes for each of the image stars. The identity of each star in the image is set to the identity of the catalogue star that cast the most votes. Once the identity of the stars is determined, the attitude of the camera is computed using a quaternion-based method. We further present a fast tracking algorithm that estimates the attitude for subsequent images after the first algorithm has terminated successfully. Our method runs in comparable speed to state of the art algorithms but is still more robust than them. The system has},
