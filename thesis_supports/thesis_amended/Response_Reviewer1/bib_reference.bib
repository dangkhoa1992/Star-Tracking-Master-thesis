	abstract = {This paper presents a novel star identification algorithm for a "Lost-In-Space" mode star tracker. The spearman correlation approach provides reliable recognition even when the captured images are swayed and biased from the onboard star pattern database. The hamming distance approach provides a shortlisted list of star IDs. Thus, the proposed combination of hamming distance and spearman correlation provides a reliable and fast recognition. The achievable performance is evaluated by testing on simulated and real images.},
